# Storyblok quick starter project

Welcome to this sample project for Astro!
This project serves as a quick starter for integrating Storyblok, a headless CMS, into your web development projects.

For starting, you can access to the `website` folder.
In the folder you have some files like:

- `astro.config.mjs`: the configuration with Storyblok API;
- `src/pages/index.astro`: the initialization of the Storyblok Bridge.
